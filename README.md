Majority of inspiration + a chunk of netty-helping code comes from the 
[Play Framework netty server backend](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/tree/master/framework/src/play-netty-server).
Credits to them for a lot of the gluework for netty.

## Progress

- [x] Server builder 
- [x] SSL
- [ ] MountService (I don't want it)
- [ ] (Maybe) Server header
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] More tests
- [ ] Profilin'

## Try it!

Fork the repo, move to the examples project and play with the `ServerBuilder` there.
